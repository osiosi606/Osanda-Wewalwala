------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Utilising Data from the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water I have made a comparative analysis of Australia's Greenhouse gas emissions to other countries.

I have displayed this analysis within an interactive Tableau Dashboard where Australia's annual Greenhouse Gas Emmisions can be compared to any other countries.
